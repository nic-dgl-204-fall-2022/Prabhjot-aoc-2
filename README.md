## Overview of the problem

For my Advent of Code assignment- 2 I decided to solve the [Advent of Code- 2015, Day- 11th](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/11) problem. In this problem, I have to find the new password for Santa. The problem imposes three restrictions to find new password which is as following-
-	Passwords must include one increasing straight of at least three letters, like ```abc, bcd, cde, and so on, up to xyz```. They cannot skip letters; abd doesn't count.
-	Passwords may not contain the letters ```i, o, or l```, as these letters can be mistaken for other characters and are therefore confusing.
-	Passwords must contain at least two different, non-overlapping pairs of letters, like ```aa, bb, or zz```.

Under these conditions, the password should be made or created. 

Also for part 2 we have to find the next password, after taking the correct password from part 1. We will take it as input for part 2.
